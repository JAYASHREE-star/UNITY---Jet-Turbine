# 🛩️ Jet Turbine Simulation - Unity

This Unity project simulates a basic Jet Turbine engine model to demonstrate thrust mechanics and turbine behavior in a 3D environment. It’s ideal for educational visualization, physics demonstrations, or extending into flight simulations.

## 🚀 Features

- Realistic jet turbine 3D model and animation
- Thrust generation with user input
- Particle effects for exhaust
- Audio effects for engine startup and running
- UI throttle control slider
- Modular, clean code structure (C#)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Unity Engine (version 2020.3 or higher recommended)
- C# scripts for logic and simulation
- Particle Systems
- Unity UI for user input

## 🎮 Controls

- Use the **throttle slider** in the UI to increase or decrease engine power.
- The turbine spins faster and emits more thrust as you increase power.
- Audio and particle effects respond dynamically to thrust input.

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Unity Hub.
3. Open the `MainScene` under `Assets/Scenes`.
4. Press **Play** to simulate the turbine.
5. Adjust throttle to test the engine dynamics.

## 🎯 Future Improvements

- Add temperature and fuel gauges
- Link thrust to aircraft movement
- Integrate physics-based airflow mechanics
- VR support for immersive simulation

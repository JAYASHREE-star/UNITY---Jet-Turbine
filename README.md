🛠️ Jet Turbine Simulation - Unity Project
A 3D interactive simulation built in Unity to demonstrate the working principles of a Jet Turbine Engine for educational and engineering visualization purposes.

🚀 Features
✅ Realistic 3D model of a jet engine

🔄 Animated turbine blades and air intake

💨 Simulated air flow and combustion process

🎛️ Interactive UI to control speed, throttle, and temperature

📊 Real-time engine data visualization (RPM, Pressure, Temp)

🎧 Optional sound effects for engine roar and airflow
